# Spaced Repetition Capstone Mason & Austin

## About

This project is built to help users learn a new language, by pulling a list of words from our custom backend the client
will display those words and a user will have to type their guess as to what the translation is, upon guessing
the client will display incorrect or correct messages and update the incorrect/correct counts for each particular word 
and update the total current score with each guess, correct guesses add 1 to the score, incorrect remove 1 from the total score
